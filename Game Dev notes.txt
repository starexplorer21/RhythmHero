Game Dev notes:

Lets do this
For every time we find a hold note, tell it to hit
then when it hits, it'll hold itself in place and then as that happens
the middle pieces all fly by. 
then when the end comes
that'll have a judgement and we'll check the hit on that
when it happens on the release, queue_free the entire note. 
so we'll pacakge everything into one node later.
